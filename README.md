This is a simple web-based Student Management System that helps you keep track of student records. You can add, update, delete, and view student details all through an easy-to-use interface.
1. Install the Required Software:
   Make sure you have these installed on your computer:
       Python – The programming language the project is built with.
       Django – The web framework.
       XAMPP  – MySQL database.
2. Start the Database:
   Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
   Open your browser and go to phpMyAdmin.
   Create a new database.
   This is where all the student records will be stored.
3. Connect the Project to the Database:
   Now, the project needs to know where to store data.
   Open the project folder and look for a settings file.
   Inside this file, there’s a section where you need to enter the database details—like the name, user, and password.
4. Set Up the Project:
   Now, Django needs to prepare the database and set up everything. There’s a simple process for this where Django creates the necessary 
   tables inside the database.
5. Create an Admin Account:
   To manage student records, you’ll want access to the Admin Panel. Django allows you to create an admin account, which you’ll use to log
   in and manage everything.
6. Start the Project:
   Once everything is ready, you can start the project and open it in your browser. Django runs a local server, and you can access it by
   visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/
